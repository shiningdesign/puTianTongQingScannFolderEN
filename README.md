# puTianTongQingScannFolderEN based on original 20200623 Chinese version from HongLiAnimation
the English ascii code translated version of Maya Mel PuTianTongQing virus scan and clean tool from honglianimation.com, 
and I added one drag and drop install.mel file for easy maya install onto shelf, and I also added one auto launch dos cmd file for easy launch from desktop. 
also I added a scanner icon for it (it shows in Maya shelf and you need to setup your own for batch shortcut icon).

It is based on this article, 
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/uoPPLvE_8LNKlOcHxkeRxw

and the tool is orginally in Chinese, and download from here:
www.honglianimation.com/res/pttq.zip

Then I translated into English and Ascii code only, so those who use English only system can run the tool without error and can understand the interface and code comments.

Notes:
  * right now this tool only fix MA file, no mb file fix, for mb file fix, need to use Maya autodesk tool
  * https://apps.autodesk.com/MAYA/en/Detail/Index?id=8637238041954239715&os=Win64&appLang=en

How to Use Instruction:
  * download the whole package as zip, unpack
  * use the dos Batch file to run as standalone windows tool (need python and pyside installed first)
  * or drag the install_puTianTongQingScannFolderEN.mel into maya viewport to put on current shelf tool, and run directly inside maya
  * example is inside the notes
